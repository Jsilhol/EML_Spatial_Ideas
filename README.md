# EML_Spatial_Ideas

Trying to figure out how to extract metadata from spatial files and to create an [EML](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/) (Ecological Metadata Language) file. 

This project started as a internship mission at the [Pôle National de Données de Biodiversité](https://www.pndb.fr/pages/fr/outils/portail-pndb) (PNDB), french biodiversity data hub. The aim was to start thinking about how to add in the [EMLassemblyline](https://github.com/EDIorg/EMLassemblyline) R package functions that will take as arguments spatial files (vector or raster) and output the corresponding EML file it created. The final goal would be to add these features into the [MetaShARk shiny app](https://metashark.test.pndb.fr/) as a way to create EML files of spatial files.
