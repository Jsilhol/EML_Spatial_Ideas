# EML_Spatial_Ideas
Trying to figure out how to extract and infer metadata from spatial files and create an Ecological Metadata Language (EML) file.
The main objective is to create functions that will be added to the **EMLAssemblyLine package**.
Main inspirations and packages used : 
- Capeml and capemlGIS packages
- EMLAssemblyLine 
- sf 
- raster,...
